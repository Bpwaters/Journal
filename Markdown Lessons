Markdown Lessons


Cuts:
1. To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, _this_ word would become italic.
2. to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ). This is **bold**
3. Headers are up to 6, 1 being biggest 6 being ######Smallest heading
4. how to make links to other web sites on the world wide web.
 -EG [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).
 5. two types of images
  a. The first image style is called an inline image link. To create an inline image link, enter an exclamation point ( ! ), wrap the alt text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). (Alt text is a phrase or sentence that describes the image for the visually impaired.)  
  b. You'll precede the Markdown with an exclamation point, then provide two brackets for the alt text, and then two more for the image tag, like this: ![The founding father][Father] At the bottom of your Markdown page, you'll define an image for the tag, like this: [Father]: http://octodex.github.com/images/founding-father.jpg.
6. Block quotes are done by starting with ">"
7.List by either unordered "* " or ordered "1. " you can indent with just a single space each time to change bullet point types

A quick example text:
1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.

 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.

 If you do make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.

 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter.

 By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:

 > Up and down and all around, that's how butter on salmon goes.

4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl.

 Here are some techniques on salmon-dropping:

 Make sure no trout or children are present
 Use both hands
 **Always** have a towel nearby in case of messes

Hard break is a double space like so: 

hey!
A soft break is where you use a double space (spaces indicated as full stops)
IE. this is a line of poetry..
This is the second line with a soft space in between

All done learning!
