### Day 5
Continued applied Visual Design
* transforms (uppercase/lowercase etc)
* styling of line spacing, text weighting etc
* CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model; When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom.
* Text transform is a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements
* to offset in the correct style part simply write: 
right: XXXpx;
* fixed is different to absolute, absolute keeps the item locked into place in relation with other objects whilsts fixed keeps it in the same position throughtout browser scrolling
* Colours complimentary and opposites
